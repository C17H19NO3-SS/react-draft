# Bun, React, and Tailwind CSS Template

This project is a template for building modern web applications using Bun as the runtime, React for the user interface, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It's configured with a simple build process and a development server with hot reloading.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.

### Installing

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/C17H19NO3-SS/react-draft.git .
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    The dependencies are managed by Bun. To install them, run:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `bun dev`

Runs the app in development mode. This will start a development server that watches for file changes and rebuilds the app automatically. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `bun start`

Starts the production server. This command should be used after you have built the project. It serves the optimized, static files from the `dist` directory.
